# AYAZCodeSnippets

_Easy to do trivial things._

Don't waste your time on trivial code even it is easy to write. We focus on making awesome products, right?
If you have some blocks of code, and if they are not private, it is better if you share them to other peers. Now waiting for what? Let's contribute! All of you are welcome warmly!


## How to install?
Xcode provides an area to save snippet code for later using. Press ```Control + Option + Command + 2``` to show
Code Snippet Library (right-lower corner).

Xcode saves its snippets code at location:

```bash
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
```
or
```bash
/Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets
```

Therefore, we will make a git repo which also locate at that location. Do that, we can make snippets to be updated just by pulling/pushing git repo.

So, there are two ways to make your snippet go visible on git repository.

##### Method 1
```
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
git init
git remote set-url origin https://username@github.com/username/iCodeSnippets.git

// Next, pull or push, it is up to you. Recommend that PULL first if your repo is not up-to-date.
```

##### Method 2
``` 
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/
cp CodeSnippets CodeSnippetsBackup				// Backup CodeSnippets folder if it is existing
rm -r CodeSnippets 								// Remove CodeSnippets folder
git clone https://username@github.com/username/iCodeSnippets.git CodeSnippets
cp CodeSnippetsBackup/* CodeSnippets/ 			// Optional, if you want to merge the exisiting snippets and snippets from repo

// Next, PUSH or PULL, it is up to you. Recommend that PUSH first if your repo is merged!
```

## TroubleShooting

Error: 
```bash
error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://github.com/hugo53/iCodeSnippets.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack
fatal: HTTP request failed
```

Fix:
```
git remote set-url origin https://username@github.com/username/iCodeSnippets.git
```

May need to change ownership of the Snippets folder and its subfolders

```
chmod -R 777 CodeSnippets/
```
